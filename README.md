### **Regression Modeling Project Report**

#### **Objective**
The primary objective of this project was to build and evaluate regression models to predict car prices using a dataset containing car-related features. We performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation to select the best-performing regression model.

### **Key Steps and Reasoning**

#### **1. Data Loading**
- **Steps**:
  - The dataset was loaded into the Python environment.
  - Initial inspection of the dataset was performed using `head()` and `info()`.
- **Reasoning**: Understanding the structure of the dataset, feature types, and missing values is crucial before proceeding to further steps.

---

#### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Steps**:
  - Visualized the distribution of the target variable (car prices) to check for skewness.
  - Plotted the number of cars sold by different companies.
  - Examined the correlation between numerical features and the target variable using a heatmap.
- **Reasoning**: EDA helps in identifying patterns, relationships, and potential issues such as skewed distributions, which influence preprocessing and model decisions.

---

#### **3. Data Cleaning**
- **Steps**:
  - Removed duplicate rows.
  - Imputed missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean/mode).
  - Checked and corrected data types of all columns.
- **Reasoning**: Clean data ensures accurate model training and reduces the risk of errors during preprocessing or modeling.

---

#### **4. Feature Engineering**
- **Steps**:
  - Separated features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable).
  - Scaled numerical features to standardize their ranges.
  - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
- **Reasoning**: Proper feature scaling and encoding improve the performance and stability of machine learning algorithms.

---

#### **5. Splitting the Dataset**
- **Steps**:
  - Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`.
  - Ensured reproducibility by setting a random seed.
- **Reasoning**: Splitting ensures the model is evaluated on unseen data, providing a realistic estimate of its performance.

---

#### **6. Model Building**
- **Steps**:
  - Trained five different regression models: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, KNN Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
  - Integrated the preprocessing pipeline with each model for efficient data transformation and training.
- **Reasoning**: Testing multiple algorithms allows us to compare their performance and select the most suitable model for the problem.

---

#### **7. Model Evaluation**
- **Steps**:
  - Evaluated each model’s performance on the test set using:
    - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
    - **R² Score**: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
  - Compared results to identify the best-performing model.

- **Reasoning**:
  - Low MSE and high R² scores indicate better model performance.
  - Using multiple metrics ensures a comprehensive evaluation.

---

#### **8. Results and Comparison**
- **Findings**:
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor** had the lowest MSE (8.008019e+06) and highest R² score (0.853846).
  - **KNN Regressor** and **Random Forest Regressor** also performed well but slightly lagged behind Gradient Boosting.
  - **Decision Tree Regressor** had the highest error and lowest R², indicating overfitting.

- **Conclusion**: The **Gradient Boosting Regressor** was selected as the best model due to its superior accuracy and lower error.

---

#### **9. Recommendations and Next Steps**
- **Recommendations**:
  - Deploy the Gradient Boosting Regressor model for predicting car prices.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning to further improve its performance.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Test the model on new datasets to ensure generalizability.
  - Explore feature importance from the Gradient Boosting model to understand the most influential features.
